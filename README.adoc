== For workstation build.
Move `vale` into `~/bin` directory
Move styles into `~/.config/vale/styles'
Move `~/.vale.ini` into home directory.





== The Rest
https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[Vale] is an open-source, command-line linter for prose. It's fast, syntax-aware, and extensible.


[NOTE]
This repo is meant to be installed into the styles directory of your `$HOME/.config/vale/styles/`. This is not the https://github.com/errata-ai/vale[VALE] repository. It is a GLS suppliment to the linter files.



Install the Vale repo to your home/bin directory and unzip it to your home/.config directory.

$ wget https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases/download/v2.7.1/vale_2.7.1_Linux_64-bit.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf vale_2.7.1_Linux_64-bit.tar.gz -C /home/$USER/.config

https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/[release_version]

Create a .vale.ini file and keep it in the home directory. (Or move the one from this directory which is the one Ive used)

StylesPath = /home/dspohn/.config/vale/styles
MinAlertLevel = error

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, write-good

[*.xml]
BasedOnStyles = GLS, Vale, write-good
#Transform = /home/dspohn/.config/vale/docbook-xsl-snapshot/html/docbook.xsl
Transform = /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.79.2/html/docbook.xsl

write-good.TooWordy=suggestion

I think there is a GLS style out there but did not locate it.

Styles
*You’ll need to create a vale/styles directory inside the .config directory.*

Clone some style directories from https://github.com/errata-ai/styles inside $USER/.config/vale/styles:
git clone https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good.git
Rename good-write to write-good2 and copy the write-good inside of it to the styles directory. Note that the style directories must be copied because Vale does not follow symbolic links.

DO250 has some styles already built up that works but is for asciidoc. Some like RedHat Branding would be useful.

NOTES:
1. I believe vale expects the config to be in your home directory if it can not find it somewhere else.
1b.) It will look in the current working directory, or if not found, keep moving up a directory looking for it (up to 6).
guides/en-US/sg-chapters/topics/<BLAH>


Discussion:
1(summary): where to put the ini file, and make sure everyone is using the same "thing".
2(summary): where to store styles, which sytles, and the "central" location for them.
3. Installing vale, should just be extracting the tar file and putting it in the bin directory.
4.(The XSL file to transform XML into HTML should also be available, but we use the Flamel packages (could be the redhat-training-xsl package)
